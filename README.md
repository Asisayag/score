Starting Allegro


1.	Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html
2.	Access this link: https://connections.houston.hp.com/groups/score?view=documents .
3.	Click on hello score 0.1 binaries, then click Download, beneath hello-score.7z. This will start downloading an archive with a jar inside.
4.	Extract the jar anyplace you like and open a Command Line there. 
5.	Now execute this inside the Command Line: 
java -jar hello-score-0.1.217-with-dependencies.jar org.openscore.samples.CommandLineApplication
Note that the version of the jar could be different. Be sure to change accordingly.
This starts the Allegro command line application.
6.	A List of available flows get printed. You can choose one of them by entering the corresponding number. Once flow starts you get prompted for inputs.
